1. Choose a framework and explain why

I chose Cypress first of all because I have more experience with it than with Playwright.
I also like the fast testing experience that it has because it operates directly in the browser and executes the
tests in real time.
It's also really easy to get started with Cypress, including installation and configuration.
The built-in debugging tools Cypress has and the extensions you can add also make the QAs work (and life) easier.
Although it gets complicated with some elements (like iframes) we can always find a workaround for these kind of
issues due to the great documentation and community it has.
